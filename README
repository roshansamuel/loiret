Loiret - Multigrid Poisson Solver

Loiret is an MPI parallelized Poisson solver written in C++, named after place where the mathematician Poisson was born.

All the files relevant to the multigrid solver are contained in the following directories:
./lib/ - contains all the header and source files used by the library
./compile/ - contains the installation scripts to build and compile the solver
./input/ - contains the parameters.yaml file which has to be read by the solver at runtime

Prerequisites:
    blitz - All array manipulations are done by the blitz library
    cmake - Necessary to make the executable from the source files
    mpich - The compiler used is mpic++
    yaml - The input parameters are stored in the parameters.yaml file which needs the yaml library to parse.

To compile and run the solver, run the compileLoiret.sh shell script in the install directory
